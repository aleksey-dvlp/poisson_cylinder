Solution of the poisson equation in the cylindrical coordinates


Numerical solution of the poisson equation in the cylindrical coordinates. data.out - the output file that contains
three columns: the node coordinate value, value of the function of the node as a numerical solution and the analitical solution.
Thomson's algorithm is used to solve system of linear equations.
Number of nodes are specified in the source code.
To run: type make and then ./run .
